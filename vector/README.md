# parallel-codes
Is a matehmatical operations, takes two vectors (arrays) with the same length, multiply them element by element,  stores the result into another vector with the same length.
As in Figure 1, 3 vectors with the same length a,b, and c. Multiply each element from vector a with the same element location in vector b, and stores the result in the same element location in vector c.
